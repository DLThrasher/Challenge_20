# Challenge_20



In this challenge I was tasked with creating smart contract equipped with the functionality of joint savings account. The purpose was to design an account for two indivduals to deposit and withdraw funds. This was done however for some reason I was unable to use the JavaScript VM. I used London in this case but my results did not come out as clean as they should have.
